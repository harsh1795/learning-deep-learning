# Vanishing Gradients Visualization
In this notebook, we will work through the vanishing gradients problem through several visualizations. We will look at a few ways to address this problem and understand them through visualizations.
We will also build a general multi-layer neural network to help understand the effect of depth of the network on its performance.
